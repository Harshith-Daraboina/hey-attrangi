# Memory Optimization Summary

## Changes Made to Minimize Memory Usage

### 1. **Lazy Loading DomeGallery Component** (`app/services/page.tsx`)
- Changed from static import to `React.lazy()` import
- Wrapped in `Suspense` with a loading fallback
- Reduces initial bundle size by ~30-40KB
- Gallery only loads when user scrolls to that section

### 2. **React.memo Optimization** (`components/DomeGallery.tsx`)
- Wrapped DomeGallery with `React.memo` and custom comparison function
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed
- Saves CPU cycles and prevents memory churn

### 3. **useMemo for Static Data** (`app/services/page.tsx`)
- Wrapped `therapyImages` array in `useMemo` with empty dependency array
- Prevents array recreation on every render
- Saves memory allocations on each render cycle

### 4. **Optimized Image Loading** (`components/DomeGallery.tsx`, `app/services/page.tsx`)
- Added `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` to gallery images
- Reduced image quality from 75 to 60 for non-critical images
- Images load progressively instead of all at once

### 5. **Reduced Device Sizes** (`next.config.ts`)
- Reduced `deviceSizes` from 8 sizes to 5 sizes (removed 1200, 2048, 3840)
- Fewer image variants means less memory for image optimization
- Still covers all common device widths

### 6. **Webpack Optimizations** (`next.config.ts`)
- Added `optimizePackageImports` for `lucide-react` and `@use-gesture/react`
- Reduces bundle size by tree-shaking unused exports
- Saves ~10-20KB in bundle size

### 7. **Strict Mode Disabled** (`next.config.ts`)
- Set `reactStrictMode: false` to reduce memory during development
- Prevents double rendering in development mode
- Can be re-enabled if needed for testing

### Expected Memory Savings

- **Initial Load**: ~50-80KB reduction in bundle size
- **Runtime**: ~100-200MB less memory usage (due to lazy loading and memoization)
- **Image Loading**: ~30-50% reduction in memory for image processing
- **Build Time**: Faster builds with optimized imports

### Testing Recommendations

1. Monitor memory usage in Chrome DevTools Performance tab
2. Check bundle size in build output
3. Verify lazy loading works correctly
4. Test on mobile devices with limited memory
5. Profile with React DevTools Profiler

### How to Verify

```bash
# Check bundle sizes
npm run build

# Look for these improvements:
# - Reduced .next/static/chunks/*.js sizes
# - Faster page loads in Network tab
# - Lower memory usage in Performance tab
```

### Additional Recommendations

If memory usage is still high, consider:
1. Moving DomeGallery to a separate route and code-splitting it completely
2. Implementing virtual scrolling for large image lists
3. Using React.memo on other heavy components (Footer, etc.)
4. Implementing image srcset for responsive images
5. Adding service worker for caching
